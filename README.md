# Remember Me
 
The story puts us in the shoes of Markus, an assassin who dies in the worst possible way and awakens in a limbo between the world of the living and the world of the dead, where he must rectify his darkest and most bizarre sins committed in life. Will he succeed? Or will his remorse overpower Markus?
